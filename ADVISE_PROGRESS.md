Canonical branding: `icon.jpeg` = APP ICON; `logo.jpeg` = FULL LOGO. New revision overrides older branding descriptions and older no-commit instructions. Phases are tested and committed separately; no production deploy/main merge/live Meta spending.

## FAZ 0 — focused audit

- Status: baseline regression passed; implementation next is EK FAZ 1A/1B.
- Files changed: this progress file, handoff and rollout documents; existing untracked source-only test helpers must be included explicitly where required by baseline tests.
- Commit: pending green baseline.
- Tests: backend 41/41 and Flutter 48/48 passed; Flutter analyze: no issues.
- Working architecture: Express/JSON tenant persistence, Graph/Interactions, Flutter shared Android/Web/Windows, durable publish phases, tenant/account file locks.
- Source findings: Gemini has per-attempt timeout but no overall budget; strategy includes several unbounded aggregate Graph reads before generation. Tenant write lock may wait up to 10 minutes. Sequential ad creation + cleanup can exceed the 90s client timeout. No persisted ad creation idempotency/saga state. Provider 502 errors are reduced to generic AppError text. UI finally exists for create but strategy cleanup is not in finally.
- Risk boundaries: no runtime JSON/uploads/.env in commits; partial Graph creates must not be blindly replayed; preserve existing tenant/account locks and user changes.
- Remote reference: origin/WIP has four additional commits; inspected names/diff, not merged. Current local HEAD remains the baseline. No force push.
- Rollback: use phase source commits to revert source on this WIP branch; never restore/reset runtime files. Production rollout requires separate human authorization.
- Next exact task: add bounded operation/error contracts, a single Meta preflight and persisted staged ad creation with stable client request IDs; test failure/partial/retry/timeout/disposal.
